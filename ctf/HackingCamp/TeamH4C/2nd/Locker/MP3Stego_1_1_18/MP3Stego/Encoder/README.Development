-----------------------------------------How to submit additions/alterations.---

To keep distribution of the encoder organized, we would like to make www.8hz.com
the definate source of info and resoures. 
We will Make pages with links to your particular project if you email
us the URL and a description of the work you are doing. People interested 
in helping you out can find you easily this way. 
Any platform/system dependend additions/alterations we would like to receive 
as '#ifdef-ed' parts in the code, to be able to compile the source easily for 
other systems.

As diff files are difficult to use (everybody will probably start out with
another source so changes are difficult to figure out if we only get the
diff file...), so we'd like to receive emails with (complete) routines/files
wich you've changed and a description thereof... 
Be especially thorough in your description of the result of your code, as we 
want to be able to understand quickly what you have added or changed. 


Our goal is to create a package that will compile on (almost) any system,
so if anybody feels like creating a 'config' script thingy or a multi-platfrom
makefile...

As MS-Windows does not generally contain GCC or whatever, the 'configure'
system will not work. There has to be some kind of 'standard' for the 
project there. We prefer MS-VC 4.x for the development. And as every available
C compiler in Windows uses it's own configuration and project files it will
be easiest if we settle on one system, to make development on that system 
straight forward. This goes for the encoder and for the frontend. 
The windows encoder is currently a 32bit console app because this will enable
VC4.x to compile the latest encoder source with allmost no problems...
If anyboy needs our VC project file or some advice for porting to Windows,
please drop us a line.

We envision the GUI's to be front-ends only, so please don't send us
integrated GUI's, because we'd like to maintain platform-independency as much
as is possible... The best way to facilitate this is to have a separate i
(command line) encoder, wich isn't cluttered with system dependend GUI code. 
This goes for the Windows GUI also, because many people have expressed that 
they want to use a command line version. 


-----------------------------------------What will we put on our site-----------

We'd like to maintain the source, if you'd like to port the encoder to a
specific platform, please put the binary on your own site, due to space and
bandwidth limitations we can't keep all binary versions on our site.

We will put the following stuff on www.8hz.com/mp3 :
- The latest version of the encoder source and sources for the GUI's.
- Binary versions for linux(ix86), FreeBSD(ix86) and MS-Windows.
- Links to *your* binaries for other platforms.
- Links to *your* frontends, with descriptions you emailed us and probably a
  picture of the GUI.
- A page dedicated to the development effort with any relevant information 
  and tips/tricks *you* email us.
  Of course links will be to where you have the source/binary available,
  eg. your page, not just the binary itself.
- Overviews of features added and changes made. 
- The comments/requests page will stay online to make it easy for users of 
  the software to express their wishes.
  If you want to help out and do not know what to do, please keep an eye on 
  that page.
- We are busy in setting up a mailing list for the development of 8hz-mp3, so
  expect to find more information on our site.

-----------------------------------------------------Requested Features.--------

Because lots of people have written to us with requests, we will note them here.
- Support other audioformats as input.
- Reading from stdin and writing to stdout.
- Improvement of sound quality.
- More speed. 
- GUI's for all kinds of platforms. 
- Less small and large bugs :)
