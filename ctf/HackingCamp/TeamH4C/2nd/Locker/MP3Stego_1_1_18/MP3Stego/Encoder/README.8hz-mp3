-----------------------------------------------------------What is 8hz-mp3 ?----
8hz-mp3 is the name for our MPEG audio encoder,

SoloH's project "MpegEnc" gave us the idea to also have a go at an free encoder,
  but with speed as our main goal, so we went at it.
  We did it to learn something and have some fun while doing so.
  It supports a number of platforms and will be ported to more eventually.
  We took the same official ISO source as SoloH did and we poked around in it 
  for a couple of days. It's free as is his, but we target more platforms. 
  The result seems not to be too bad (we think). 

At this moment this encoder only supports MPEG I layer III. 
  (but hey, what else would you want to encode anyway ??)
  This encoder seems to be reasonably fast and it's totally free...


-----------------------------------------------------------How to use it--------

This program reads windows .wav (RIFF-WAVE-MSPCM) sample-files.
  Only 16-Bit samples are supported.
  8hz-mp3 encodes a .mp3 file with the same channel mode as the .wav file has.
  (either mono or stereo)
  
|  8hz-mp3 1998 8Hz software
|  USAGE   : 8hz-mp3 [options] infile outfile
|  OPTIONS : -h            this help message
|            -b bitrate    set the bitrate, default 128kbit
|            -c            set copyright flag, default off
|            -o            set original flag, default off

  Valid samplerates are : 32000, 44100 and 48000Hz
  (eg, samples with other samplerates are rejected by the encoder.)
  Valid bitrates are : 32,40,48,56,64,80,96,112,128,160,192,224,256 and 320

For example :
|  8hz-mp3 -b 128 -c -o blah.wav blah.mp3
(This will encode the sample blah.wav into blah.mp3, with a bitrate of
 128kBit/sec with the 'copyright' and 'original' flags set to 'on')
The copyright and original flags do not add anything to the mp3 file, they 
just let you specify the status of the music file.

-----------------------------------------------------------Known misfeatures----

These are the know misfeatures (bugs ?:)
  *It is known to crash. (but not often *phew*)
  *If you want the best quality, you should go with a Fraunhofer encoder.
   These really are the best, by far. Speed or no speed. 
   Xing-engine based programs are blazing fast, but they cut-off at 16Khz, 
   so they have way less work to do.
   8hz-mp3 is a nice go at something usefull, but quality wise it is under par.
   (Quality is on the same level as the other (ISO Source based) free encoder 
    'MpegEnc' from SoloH:  http:www.isafeelin.org/SoloH)
  *Some residual debug output will from time to time be printed.

-----------------------------------------------------------How to contribute----

As it will be very exciting (and usefull :) to have the software on all kinds
  of machines/OS' and due to the many requests we have decided to put the 
  source of the next version online, so everybody can port it to the platforms 
  they desire.

We'd like to 'coordinate' a wider effort to get these ISO sources fast and
  better than they are now, many people have already mentioned they'd like to
  help. When the sources for v0.2 are available we'll be waiting for all your 
  patches and updates to use them in the next version.
